### mysql 的安装 

* 一般采取的做法是 与安装mongodb时一样， 我们以net 命令 将 mysql 服务安装到后台之中

* 按 win + s 键 输入 services 打开服务面板，查看已经安装的服务，

> a list of services that are running, we we open our computer

net start 服务名

net stop 服务名

sc delete mysql // 这句命令 一是不能利用powershell 运行，没反应； 而是 需要 cmd 的管理员权限；

1. 安装mysql

> 安装版的即使下载的时 5.6.4 版本的，实际安装的还是 8.0.1 版本的，所以直接去下 zip 版本的就可以了； 按照下面的安装步骤进行安装

2. 初始化密码

```bash
# 在mysql的bin目录下输入:
mysqladmin -u root -p password 123456

# 出现enter password后，直接回车，即可
# 之所以按回车 是因为我们的初始密码就是 回车

```

3. 登陆

https://blog.csdn.net/hjulkk/article/details/52562894

```bash
mysql -u root -p 

#  自己设置的密码为 123456

```

4. 卸载

* 停止服务 net stop mysql
* 删除服务 sc delete mysql
* 删除 解压的文件夹



### navicat 的安装 以及 数据库的导入 导出

1. 安装包 ：  自己放到了百度云上了

2. 数据的导出

* 这个数据库上面，鼠标右键，选择转储SQL文件---> 结构和数据
* 选择 导出的位置

3. 数据的导入

* 右键 服务组（小海豚logo） ---> 新建数据库 ---> 命名的方式应与要导入的名字一致
* 双击新建的数据库（新建的数据库是灰色的，双击之后变为绿色）
* 右键新建的数据库 --> 运行 sql 文件 --> 选择自己备份的sql文件 --> 运行 


### principle

1. table: is realation 

* columns are the headers of the table , the table will also have a name , so we can say this is the membership table, then the columns are going to list the data we want to store about memerships(全体会员) . 

* rows are data that we put in to match these columns , but we give actural data not just categories of data 

* we can think of the rows as instances of whatever the table is describing,  so each row is an example of membership(会员) 

* record : is just another name for a row ; 即 record 与 row 时同一个东西的两种说法；

* field : usually describes one value inside of a column or you aiso call it a cell .  some people will think the whole column is a field 

* entry: 条目

2. database design : is known as data integrity(数据完整性)

> database design makes us ask questions like what tables do i need , what columns do i put in that table , do i allow them to be null or do i force then all to have a value 


3. entity && attribute

* an entity is just a thing we store data about 
* attributes are the things we store about that entity  

4. data integrity

* data integrity means that the attributes we are tstoring about the entity  

5. primary key 

* primary key is unique and not null   
    + natrual key is something that exists in the real world ,e.g, email
    + surrogate key is just a value that's generated by the database genarally an ID 

6. foreign key is a column that references column in another table . Often This will point back to a primary key but It could not have to reference a primary key , it colud reference unicle column. essentially(本质上) it's just a way to reference another entity and that entity has to be labeled unique or else it's not going to know which entity you want to reference .  

7. constraint are something that are important to protect our data interity because they force relationships to hold true 

8. data type: there is one situation where you need to be extra careful with the data type that you give a column . when you have a foreign key word and it reference a primary key , they both have to be the same type that's super important if you're having problems creating foreign keys that might be part of the problem (the primary key might be a different data type than what you are trying to make the foreign key ) 

9. index : you can tell the database to index important columns and in fact it's going to index certain columns automatically , primary keys and unique columns are automatically indexed, but foreign keys on hte other hand are not automatically indexed but oftentimes you will want to manually index them because we use them so much . what an index does is increase the speed that we can work with these columns . so we are going to select a column that are part of an index we are going to have a much faster query 

10. relationship 

> relationShips are created when we have a column that references column in a database this is what's known as a foreign key .  
> A column is a forrign key if it references another column and that column it references has to be either a primary key or have the unique attribute 
> when we do above we create a relationship.

* there are three types of relationships:
    + one-to-one
    + one-to-many
    + many-to-many

    ![](./img-md/many-to-many.png)

*  one-to-one relationship： is an attribute that describes an entity you can just store it in the same table , you don't have to create a whole another table for it  you can though . Though if you want that separation for some reason ,e.g., you want some data of the user stored in a different table . The only thing you're going to remember is to mark the foreigin key as unique that's because we don't want to have mutiple entries relating back to one entity that would break the rules of one-to-one and that is acturally how you set up a one-to-many relationship


* one-to-many : we can store as many rows as we want referencing back to a single entity and that foreign key is not going to be labeled unique . The parent table being referenced doesn't need to know about this other table , you don't have to put any foreign keys in that table to that table that other table donesn't exist . It's just alone by itself , but that table that references  it knows of the parent table 

> in summary one-to-one is just one table. One-to-many is two tables. Many-tomany is three tables


#### data integrity

1. entity interity

> entity interity is very simple . All it says is that every table needs a primary key when you label something a primary key . It's automatically going to be unique and not null . Addition to this a primary key should never change  . `Unique` `not null` `never change`

2. There is acturally teo classifications(类别) of primary keys 

* surrogate keys(代理鍵) 

> surrogate key are simple . They just are computer generated numbers that have no real world meaning 

* natural keys 



2. referential integrity

3. domain integrity
